4. **Linux has a standard file system hierarchy, which is different from Windows.**  
In Linux, everything is treated as a file â€” even hardware devices like hard drives and network cards.

### **Main Directory Structure**

| **Folder** | **Function** |
|------------|--------------|
| `/`        | Root directory (the top level). |
| `/home`    | Personal folder for each user. |
| `/etc`     | System configuration files. |
| `/bin`     | Core programs/commands such as `ls`, `cp`, `mv`. |
| `/var`     | Logs, cache, and variable files. |
| `/usr`     | Additional programs and libraries. |
| `/tmp`     | Temporary files. |
| `/dev`     | Devices such as hard drives (`/dev/sda`), USB, etc. |

> ğŸ’¡ **Tip:** In Linux, **everything is treated as a file**, including devices like hard drives and network cards.
